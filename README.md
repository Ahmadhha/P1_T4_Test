# Project Title: Crime rate Analysis in Toronto by Neighbourhoods 

## Team Members:

•	Ahmed Abdelrahman

•	Geon Woo Jeong

•	Mary Toofani

## Background Story: 

### We are a team in a data analytics company, and we have recently been asked by an insurance company to find various crime data of different sectors of Toronto to help them find out risk factors for each district. Premiums are calculated based on the risk factors, so our data is important in setting the right premiums. We have come up with the following questions in order to help the insurance company calculate reasonable premiums so that they can charge their clients appropriately. 

##	Project Description / Outline

Crime rates are analysed per neighbourhood in Toronto during xyz years.

## Research questions to Answer

1- Crimes/Capita per year for Toronto (V) and each neighbourhood

2- Crimes/Capita of crimes per year for the top and bottom 10 neighbourhoods (V)

3- Crimes/Capita of crimes per category for Toronto (V) and each of the 20 Neighbourhoods (V)

4- Crimes/Capita of crimes per premise for Toronto (V) and each of the 20 Neighbourhoods (V)

5- Crimes/Capita of crimes per weekday/weekend for Toronto (V) and each of the 20 Neighbourhoods (V)

6- Crimes/Capita of crimes per Season for Toronto (V) and each of the 20 Neighbourhoods (V)

7- pre and post covid period

8- Crimes/Capita of crimes per premise type (or location)

### Crime Rate vs. Season Pie Chart (Geon Woo) 
This plot is made to show the percentages of crime occurrences distinguished by the four seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). This analysis was done to find out whether climate has any relationship with crime rates, and as it clearly shows, there is little evidence that climate affects crime, because the percentages are very evened-out across the seasons. 

### Crime Rate vs. Premise Type Pie Chart (Geon Woo)
This plot shows the percentages of crime occurrences across all of Toronto by premise type. Crimes happen most often outside (26.4%), but personal properties such as apartments (24%) and houses (18%) account for a total of 42% of all crimes. In our study, we focus on violent crimes such as assault, and property crimes like robbery and auto theft. The percentages do not account for other crimes such as substance abuse, because we don't do drugs, and it is not related to our safety.
