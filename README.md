## Background Story: 

### We are a team in a data analytics company, and we have recently been asked by an insurance company to find various crime data of different sectors of Toronto to help them find out risk factors for each district. Premiums are calculated based on the risk factors, so our data is important in setting the right premiums. We have come up with the following questions in order to help the insurance company calculate reasonable premiums so that they can charge their clients appropriately. 

##	Project Description / Outline

Crime rates are analysed per neighbourhood in Toronto during 2015 - 2021.

## Research questions to Answer

Where are the safest Areas in GTA?
What are the different types of Crime in GTA?
What are most and least safe 5 neighborhoods in GTA?
How does the crime rate change during seasons?
How does the crime rate change during weekdays or weekends?
How does the crime rate change during day/night?
How does the crime rate change vs premises type?
How crime rates vary in different districts of Toronto?
How crime rate vary for most and least safe 5 neighborhoods?

## Summary and Results:

The conclusions of the analysis are as follow:

1.The safest areas in GTA are: Pleasant View, Centennial Scarborough, Mount Pleasant East, Yonge St.Clair and Steels. They are locations with the lowest risk factors, which indicates that customers who are willing to open a business in these areas are charged with the least amount of premiums. 
2. Five least safe areas are: Moss Park, Bay Street Corridor, Church-Yonge Corridor, Kensington-China Town and University), indicating high risk factors.
3. Different types of crime in GTA are (In order from highest to lowest) Assualt, Break and Enter, Auto Theft and Theft Over $5000.
4. The pie chart for crime rate vs premises type shows that crime, regardless of type, happens most often outside, then in apartments, and commercial locations, and least happens in education and transit areas. While crimes happening outside is a redundant information, the relatively high percentages of crime occurrences in apartments (24%), commercial buildings (20.5%), and houses (17.8%) important because they are accounted for in calculating the premium. 
5. Crime rate doesnt show any significant changes during seasons. The insurance company does not have to take climate into account when calculating premium. 
6. Crime rate doesnt show any significant changes during weekdays or weekends, which indicates that premiums be equal regardless of whether the insurance company's clients operate on weekdays or weekends. 
7. Crime rate shows that most crimes happen during the evening and least happen in the morning. Time of day can be accounted for when calculating premium. For example, if a business operates in a relatively high-risk area as well as at night, the insurance company may apply a higher risk factor, which results in a higher premium cost. 
8. The regression model of crime rates in Toronto shows a gradual increase annually, but with an r-squared value of 0.12, which indicates that the relationship between crime rates and time is neither strong in positive nor negative direction.
9.The regression models of crime rates for 5 most and least safe neighborhood plotted as well. While some have a strong correlation, others show a very marginal r-squared value, so it is difficult to assume that the risk factors would naturally increase over the years.
